This is a README for 0x11. C - printf project.

In this project we were tasked with writing functions that replicated printf's writing capabilities.

The primary file being utilized is _printf.c, which contains the _printf function itself. This file is linked to a header file named holberton.h, as well as function prototypes for: 

_puts.c
_rot13.c
_print_number.c
_strlen.c
_print_binary.c
_putchar.c
_rev_string.c

A man page has been included, called: man_3_printf

The project was created by Osama Basheer and Gareth Brickman
